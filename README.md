### Introduction
This project analyzes bankruptcy cases in Poland to understand factors that contribute to business failures. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization techniques such as histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation analysis. And this is what I did: cleaned the dataset, created financial ratios and indicators, explored distributions and summary statistics, visualized key trends, and applied correlation and pattern analysis to identify risk factors associated with bankruptcy.

*Import libraries*

## Conclusion
The AB testing analysis shows differences in user behavior between control and treatment groups. Conversion rates and visualizations indicate which variation performs better, while statistical testing confirms whether the differences are significant. Through data cleaning, visualization, and hypothesis testing, the project demonstrates how AB testing can guide data-driven decisions and optimize user experiences effectively.
